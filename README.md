# About Me...
- 👋 Hi, I’m @rkehoejr11 (aka Rob)
- 👀 I’m interested in trail running, programming (data science at the moment), philosophy and food!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program (mainly with python and VBA) and trying to become a data scientist using Kaggle & Free Code Camp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. I mainly want to become familiar with GitHub and to properly collab with others.
- 📫 How to reach me rkehoejr@gmail.com!
- Happy Coding!
